# YAL
Yet Another Language is a pure functional language which is created for researching purposes

YAL have:
  1) case-expressions
  2) let-expression
  3) and basicly every useful costruction
  4) haskell-like data types
  5) pattern-matching
  6) for now it isn't really pure, but mostly is 😁
 
 YAL is staticly typed language with polymorhic types, but without kind system for now.
